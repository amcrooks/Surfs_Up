Hawaii Climate
## Overview
We are analyizing the weather in Hawaii for a Surf shop to expand. They want to ensure that the weather year round is great for surfing to build more shops.
## Reaults
- In June the weather stay consistant in 60 degree weather to provide a cool temperature for surfers to surf.
- In December the weather does drop to a cooler temperature but still provides great weather for surfing.
## Summary
From our analysis, it would be great to open more surf shops in the area. The weather is consistant enough for people to enjoy the water and a sweet treat of ice cream. I would want to run another query on the months of Jamuary and February to see if there's a chance of winter weather.
